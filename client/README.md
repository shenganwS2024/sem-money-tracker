# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})
```

ChatGPT said:
Push Your Code to a Private GitHub Repository
Follow these steps to push your code to GitHub as a private repository.

1️⃣ Create a Private Repository on GitHub
Go to GitHub.
Click on "+" (plus icon) → New Repository.
Repository name: Choose a meaningful name (e.g., sem-money-tracker).
Select Private: Ensure the "Private" option is selected.
Do NOT initialize with README (since you're pushing an existing project).
Click Create Repository.
2️⃣ Configure Git in Your Project
Open Terminal inside your project folder and run:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd /path/to/your/project  # Navigate to your project
git init                   # Initialize a new git repository (if not already initialized)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sem-money-tracker.git
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username.

3️⃣ Commit and Push Your Code
Run the following commands to add, commit, and push:

sh
Copy
Edit
git add .                           # Add all files
git commit -m "Initial commit"       # Commit changes
git branch -M main                   # Rename branch to main (if not already)
git push -u origin main              # Push to GitHub
4️⃣ Verify on GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository (https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sem-money-tracker).
You should now see your files in the repository.
5️⃣ Invite Collaborators (For Teaching Team)
Since your repo is private, you need to give access to the teaching team:

Go to your repository settings.
Click Manage Access → Invite a collaborator.
Add the teaching team’s GitHub usernames (e.g., cperaire, jmventurF2023).
Set Read access.
6️⃣ Future Updates
After making new changes, push updates with:

sh
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Updated feature XYZ"
git push origin main
✅ Now Your Code is Securely Stored in GitHub as Private! 🚀

Reasoned for a couple of seconds
In TypeScript, if you want to use "resolveJsonModule": true, you need to ensure that moduleResolution is set to something that supports it—usually "node". If you leave moduleResolution at the default (which is "classic" in certain older TS configs), you’ll get the error:

Option '--resolveJsonModule' cannot be specified when 'moduleResolution' is set to 'classic'.

How to Fix
Just add (or change) your TypeScript config so it uses "node" (or "node16", etc.) for moduleResolution. For example:

jsonc
Copy
Edit
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2019",
    "module": "esnext",
    "jsx": "react",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node"   // <-- ADD THIS
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*", ".storybook"]
}
Once that’s in place, the "resolveJsonModule": true setting should work without error.







You said:
npm run dev

> sem-money-tracker-server@1.0.0 dev
> ts-node-dev --respawn --transpileOnly src/index.ts

ts-node-dev: no script to run provided
Usage: ts-node-dev [options] script [arguments]
Reasoned for 8 seconds
That error usually means ts-node-dev can’t find the file you told it to run. In other words, the script in your package.json is not pointing to a valid file. Common causes:

File path typo (e.g., src/index.ts doesn’t actually exist, or is in a different folder).
Wrong script command in package.json (maybe you forgot to specify the file).
Running in the wrong directory (the file or package.json is not where npm run dev is being called).
1. Check your package.json Script
Make sure your dev script in package.json actually includes the file name. For example:

jsonc
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "sem-money-tracker-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpileOnly src/index.ts"
  },
  // ...
}
If your script is missing the src/index.ts part, then ts-node-dev doesn’t know which file to run, giving the error:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
ts-node-dev: no script to run provided
Usage: ts-node-dev [options] script [arguments]
Make sure the path in that script is correct:

Does your main TypeScript file live at src/index.ts?
Or is it at src/server.ts or something else?
Update accordingly.
2. Verify the File Exists
Check that the file path in your script actually exists in your project. For example, if your dev script says:

jsonc
Copy
Edit
"dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpileOnly src/index.ts"
…then confirm you really have server/src/index.ts (assuming your package.json is in the server/ folder).

If your file is server.ts or app.ts, change the script to match.
3. Run from the Correct Folder
If your package.json is in server/, you must run npm run dev inside the server/ folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd server
npm run dev
Otherwise, if your package.json is in the root of the project but your code is in server/, you might need something like:

jsonc
Copy
Edit
"dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpileOnly server/src/index.ts"
Either way, the key is to ensure the file path is correct relative to the package.json location where the script is defined.

TL;DR
In your package.json, ensure "dev" is something like:
json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpileOnly src/index.ts"
}
Check that src/index.ts really exists at that location.
Run npm run dev in the same directory as that package.json. If your code is in subfolders, update the paths accordingly.
Once you fix the script command and point to a real .ts file, ts-node-dev should run without the “no script to run provided” error.

Navigating change streams

The error arises because $changeStream only works on replica sets. To monitor Expense model changes, set up a local replica set or use Atlas. Alternatively, manually emit socket events in the route.

This error is telling you that change streams (i.e., Expense.watch([...])) require a MongoDB replica set, but your local MongoDB is running as a standalone server. By default, a typical local MongoDB instance on macOS/Windows/Linux is not a replica set—so the $changeStream stage isn’t supported and throws MongoServerError: The $changeStream stage is only supported on replica sets.

You have two main options to fix this:

1. Enable a Single-Node Replica Set Locally
Stop your local MongoDB service.

Start it again with replica set enabled (a single node in the set). For example, if you’re running mongod manually, you can do something like:

bash
Copy
Edit
mongod --replSet "rs0" --dbpath /path/to/db --bind_ip 127.0.0.1
In a separate shell, connect via mongo (or mongosh) and initialize the replica set:

bash
Copy
Edit
use admin
rs.initiate()
This sets up a one-member replica set named "rs0".

Verify it’s running as a replica set by checking rs.status() or noticing in your logs that the server indicates replSet.

Now when your Mongoose code calls Expense.watch(), MongoDB will allow change streams because it’s running as a replica set.

Pros:

You can keep using local Mongo for dev.
Real-time data watchers (watch()) will work exactly like on production replica sets.
Cons:

A bit more configuration compared to plain mongod.
2. Use MongoDB Atlas (or Another Replica Set) in the Cloud
If you don’t want to configure your local MongoDB as a replica set, you can point Mongoose to a MongoDB Atlas cluster (which is automatically a replica set). For example, in your .env or config.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
export const MONGODB_URI = 'mongodb+srv://username:password@your-cluster.mongodb.net/yourDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority';
Then your local dev code will connect to Atlas. The Expense.watch() call will work because Atlas runs on a replica set.

Pros:

No local setup needed for replica sets.
Production-like environment in the cloud.
Cons:

Requires internet connection.
You’ll need to create an Atlas account and set up a free tier cluster.
3. (Optional) Remove the watch() if You Don’t Need Real-time
If for some reason you don’t want real-time updates, you can remove the Expense.watch() line in your code:

ts
Copy
Edit
// Remove or comment this out if you don't need real-time:
Expense.watch([], { fullDocument: 'updateLookup' }).on('change', (change) => {
  ...
});
Then your code won’t attempt to create a change stream, and your local MongoDB (in standalone mode) will be fine.

Summary
Change streams (Model.watch()) only work on a replica set or sharded cluster.
Local fix: run mongod with --replSet, do rs.initiate(), then connect.
Cloud fix: use MongoDB Atlas or another hosted replica set.
No real-time needed: remove the .watch() calls.
Once you’re on a replica set, the error goes away and your real-time updates should work as intended.

The current code is problematic, this rule "The application uses real-time dynamic updates to display new expenses instantly on all screens connected to the server via a WebSockets library like Socket.IO. You should demo this aspect using two different browsers (like Chrome and Firefox) or using a combination of the normal and private/incognito mode of a single browser." is not satified

Discussing event-driven updates

I’m digging into alternatives for .watch() in Mongoose, emphasizing manual socket event emission in routes for real-time updates on expenses. This approach is highlighted as a viable solution.

Storing socket connections

I'm figuring out how to manage the io object, considering storing it in the app instance, passing it from the server, or using a global setup for clients to receive expenseAdded broadcasts.

Setting up the socket connection

I’m detailing the socket setup in socket.ts and its integration in index.ts to ensure real-time updates on the client side. Progress is steady and clear.

Below is an example of how you can implement real-time updates with Socket.IO without relying on MongoDB’s change streams or replica sets. Instead, you manually emit a Socket event every time a new expense is added (or updated/deleted, if needed). This approach works with a standard standalone MongoDB instance and satisfies the requirement that all connected browsers see changes instantly.

How It Works
On the server:

Initialize Socket.IO when creating your HTTP server.
Store a reference to io (the Socket.IO server) in your Express app instance (or in a separate module).
In your expense route (the POST /), after saving a new expense to the database, emit a expenseAdded event via Socket.IO.
On the client:

Connect to the Socket.IO server.
Listen for expenseAdded events.
Update local state (e.g., via Redux) whenever an expenseAdded event arrives.
Since this doesn’t require Expense.watch(), you do not need a MongoDB replica set. A simple local MongoDB instance will work.

1. Server-Side Code
src/socket.ts
A small module to initialize Socket.IO and store a global reference.

ts
Copy
Edit
import { Server as HttpServer } from 'http';
import { Server } from 'socket.io';

let io: Server | null = null;

/** Initialize Socket.IO with the given HTTP server and return the io instance. */
export function initSocket(server: HttpServer) {
  io = new Server(server, {
    cors: {
      origin: '*', // In dev, allow all. Lock down in production.
    }
  });

  io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('Client connected:', socket.id);
    // If needed, handle any custom events from the client here.
  });

  return io;
}

/** Retrieve the Socket.IO instance. */
export function getIo() {
  if (!io) {
    throw new Error('Socket.io not initialized!');
  }
  return io;
}
src/index.ts
Your server’s entry point. Notice how we:

Create an HTTP server from the Express app.
Call initSocket(server) to attach Socket.IO.
Finally, store the io instance in the Express app with app.set('io', io) so our route handlers can access it.
ts
Copy
Edit
import http from 'http';
import app from './app';  // Express app
import { initSocket } from './socket';
import { PORT } from './config'; // optional

const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = initSocket(server);

// Make the Socket.IO server accessible in route handlers via app.get('io')
app.set('io', io);

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
src/routes/expense.routes.ts
Your expense API route. Here’s the key part:
After saving the expense to MongoDB, we emit a socket event—expenseAdded—with the savedExpense. Any connected clients listening on expenseAdded will instantly receive it.

ts
Copy
Edit
import { Router, Request, Response } from 'express';
import Expense from '../models/expense.model';

const router = Router();

// POST a new expense
router.post('/', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const { amount, category } = req.body;
    if (!amount || amount <= 0 || !category) {
      return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid expense data' });
    }

    const newExpense = new Expense({ amount, category });
    const savedExpense = await newExpense.save();

    // Emit the real-time event via Socket.IO
    // 1) Retrieve the io object from the app
    const io = req.app.get('io');
    // 2) Broadcast a 'expenseAdded' event to all connected sockets
    io.emit('expenseAdded', savedExpense);

    return res.status(201).json(savedExpense);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error creating expense' });
  }
});

export default router;
That’s it! Now, any time you POST /expenses, the server will emit expenseAdded with the newly created expense.

Parameter 'expenseData' implicitly has an 'any' type. // client/src/App.tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import io from 'socket.io-client';
import { useAppDispatch } from './store';
import { addExpenseRealTime, fetchExpenses } from './features/expensesSlice';
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import HomeScreen from './screens/HomeScreen';
import ExpensesScreen from './screens/ExpensesScreen';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();

  useEffect(() => {
    // 1. On mount, fetch existing expenses once
    dispatch(fetchExpenses());

    // 2. Connect to Socket.IO server
    const socket = io('http://localhost:4000');

    // 3. Listen for real-time "expenseAdded" events
    socket.on('expenseAdded', (expenseData) => {
      // Dispatch Redux action to add to store
      dispatch(addExpenseRealTime(expenseData));
    });

    // Cleanup on unmount
    return () => {
      socket.disconnect();
    };
  }, [dispatch]);

  return (
    <>
      {/* Normal routes remain intact */}
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomeScreen />} />
        <Route path="/expenses" element={<ExpensesScreen />} />
      </Routes>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;

`main.tsx`), where you listen for `expenseAdded` via Socket.IO to broadcast real-time updates across all screens. This way, your existing structure remains unchanged, and the real-time feature simply works alongside it. for 6 seconds
Ensuring type accuracy

I’m mapping out a solution to type-checking issues by specifying parameter types in socket event handlers, promoting type safety and maintainability.

In TypeScript, parameters default to any if you don’t explicitly annotate them. Here, the expenseData in your socket.on('expenseAdded', (expenseData) => { ... }) callback has no declared type. Since your assignment rules forbid using any, you need to give it a proper type.

1. Import (or Define) Your Expense Type
Assuming you already have a type or interface for Expense in a file like src/types/expense.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
// client/src/types/expense.ts
export interface Expense {
  _id?: string;
  amount: number;
  category: 'Bills' | 'Grocery' | 'Health' | 'Travel' | 'Others';
  date: string; // or Date, depending on your usage
}
2. Annotate the Parameter
In App.tsx, import that type and declare it for expenseData:

tsx
Copy
Edit
// client/src/App.tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import io from 'socket.io-client';
import { useAppDispatch } from './store';
import { addExpenseRealTime, fetchExpenses } from './features/expensesSlice';
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import HomeScreen from './screens/HomeScreen';
import ExpensesScreen from './screens/ExpensesScreen';
import { Expense } from './types/expense'; // <-- import your type

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();

  useEffect(() => {
    // On mount, fetch existing expenses
    dispatch(fetchExpenses());

    const socket = io('http://localhost:4000');

    // Add an explicit type to expenseData:
    socket.on('expenseAdded', (expenseData: Expense) => {
      dispatch(addExpenseRealTime(expenseData));
    });

    return () => {
      socket.disconnect();
    };
  }, [dispatch]);

  return (
    <>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomeScreen />} />
        <Route path="/expenses" element={<ExpensesScreen />} />
      </Routes>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
Now TypeScript knows that expenseData is an Expense, eliminating the warning and letting you enjoy proper IntelliSense if you do something like expenseData.amount.

If You Don’t Have an Expense Interface Yet
Create one! The point is to avoid any by declaring a shape that matches the data returned from your backend. For example:

ts
Copy
Edit
// client/src/types/expense.ts
export interface Expense {
  _id?: string;
  amount: number;
  category: string;
  date: string;
}
Then import and use it in your Socket.IO callback.

Quick Recap
Create or reuse a type for your expense data.
Import it into the file where you listen for expenseAdded.
Add (expenseData: Expense) to the callback parameters so it’s no longer implicitly any.
This satisfies the “no any” rule and gives you strong typing for your real-time events.

Identifying the issue

I’m thinking through the duplicate expense issue, likely from the expense being added twice—once in response to a POST request and again via a socket event. This twin addition likely stems from multiple triggers. To prevent this, ensure no double additions during updates or insert checks.

Spotting the cause

I realized the duplicate expense stemmed from the "expenseAdded" socket event unshifting the expense again. To fix this, I'll ensure the socket event is ignored if it matches an existing ID.

You’re running into a duplicate expense being added to your state (and thus rendered twice). In React, that produces a warning because two list items share the same key (_id).

This usually happens when you add the same expense in two different ways:

On POST success, you add the newly created expense to Redux.
On the Socket.IO expenseAdded event, you again add that same expense to Redux.
So from the perspective of that incognito window, it receives two instructions to insert the same expense:

One triggered by the successful POST response,
Another triggered by the server’s Socket.IO broadcast event (which also goes back to the browser that created the expense).
Hence, the same _id ends up in your Redux store twice, causing that key collision warning in React.

How to Fix It
You want exactly one addition. Here are some solutions:

Option A: Rely on Socket Updates for Everyone, Even the Poster
Remove the store update in your POST success handler (the addExpense.fulfilled case).
Instead, let only the Socket.IO expenseAdded event add the newly created expense to your local store.
Example in your slice:

ts
Copy
Edit
// If you want the client to rely solely on socket events for the final add:
builder
  .addCase(addExpense.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
    // Remove the unshift or push code here
    // Because we'll let the socket event handle it
  });
The flow then becomes:

User adds an expense → client does a POST.
Server saves to DB, emits expenseAdded to all clients (including the poster).
The poster (and everyone else) receives expenseAdded, updates Redux.
This ensures only one add operation happens in the store.

Option B: Filter Out the Duplicate on Socket Event
If you want to optimistically add the expense on POST success, you can do that. Then, in the Socket event handler, only add the expense if it’s not already in the store. For instance, in your slice:

ts
Copy
Edit
addExpenseRealTime: (state, action: PayloadAction<Expense>) => {
  // Check if we already have an expense with the same _id
  const existing = state.data.find((exp) => exp._id === action.payload._id);
  if (!existing) {
    state.data.unshift(action.payload);
  }
}
This way, even though the server broadcasts expenseAdded, your client sees “we already have that _id in state” and skips adding it again.

Option C: Emit Socket Event Only to “Other” Clients
Instead of broadcasting to all sockets, you can emit to all other sockets except the one that posted. But this complicates the code a bit, because you have to track which client added the expense. Typically you’d handle that with a socket ID or rooms, something like:

ts
Copy
Edit
io.to('everyoneElseExceptThisSocket').emit('expenseAdded', savedExpense);
…but that’s less straightforward than Options A or B.

2. The React Key Warning
The warning about duplicate keys is a direct symptom: React sees two items with the same _id, so the <ExpenseRow key={expense._id} /> is duplicated. Once you fix the underlying duplicate data logic, the key warning will disappear.

TL;DR
You’re adding the same expense twice: once via the POST response, once via the socket event.
Pick a strategy: either rely on Socket-only for the final insertion (Option A) or deduplicate in your socket handler (Option B).
That prevents the duplicate _id in your Redux store and resolves the key conflict in React.
